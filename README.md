# Iris-dataset Machine learning

This dataset is classic dataset for visualisation, classification and machine learning. 


It contains 3 classes (Iris species) with 50 samples each of four different features, i.e. sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. 

Among three iris species, Setosa species is linearly separable from others

Target or Prediction: Different species of Iris plant




## Objective

The objective of this project  is to gain exposure of machine learning classification concepts and data visualisation.
